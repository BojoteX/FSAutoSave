# FSAutoSave
Automatically save your Flights in Flight Simulator so you can resume where you left. FSAutoSave is easy to install and use and does not require any external configuration. It will automatically save your flight when you end a session or by pressing CTRL+ALT+S. 

## Installation
Just run in the same computer where you run MSFS. It will automatically detect when the simulator is running. No need to configure anything. Program will show you exactly what it is doing and when it is saving your flight.

## Limitations
The program uses the SimConnect API to save your flight, so if the aircraft you are using does not SAVE internally its state FSAutoSave will simply save only the position and other basic variables. This program works 100% with PMDG, you'll have to test other aircraft to see if it works.

## Compiling
If you want to compile the program yourself, you will need to install the MSFS SDK.
